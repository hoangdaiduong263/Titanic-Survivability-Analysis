# Titanic-Survivability-Analysis
This repository contains the data and analysis related to determining the factors affecting survivability on the Titanic using logistic regression. The Titanic dataset is a well-known dataset that provides information on the passengers aboard the Titanic and whether they survived the disaster.

**1. Data Description:**

The dataset titanic.csv contains multiple observations and several variables, each providing crucial information about the passengers. Below is a detailed description of each variable:
- Survived: Survival status (0 = No, 1 = Yes).
- Pclass: Passenger class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd).
- Name: Name of the passenger.
- Sex: Gender of the passenger (male, female).
- Age: Age of the passenger in years.
- Siblings/Spouses Aboard: Number of siblings/spouses aboard the Titanic.
- Parents/Children Aboard: Number of parents/children aboard the Titanic.
- Fare: Passenger fare.
**2. Objective:**

This analysis aims to identify the key determinants of survivability on the Titanic using logistic regression. By understanding which factors influenced survival, we can gain insights into the characteristics and behaviors that played a role during the disaster.
